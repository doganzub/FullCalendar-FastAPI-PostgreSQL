FullCalendar Integration with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, and PostgreSQL
⭐ Welcome to the ultimate guide for integrating FullCalendar with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, and PostgreSQL! ⭐

This project provides a comprehensive, ready-to-use template for developers who want to integrate FullCalendar into their FastAPI web applications. The project is designed for both learning purposes and real-world implementations, offering hands-on examples and educational notes.

🚀 About the Project
This project demonstrates how to integrate the FullCalendar event management system into a FastAPI backend using:

SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
PostgreSQL as the database
Jinja2 templating engine for rendering the frontend
Whether you're building a scheduling app, a booking system, or simply need a calendar interface, this project gives you a clean and scalable foundation to build on.

🎯 Target Audience
This project is ideal for:

Beginner to intermediate FastAPI developers looking to learn FullCalendar integration.
Developers who need a fast and customizable calendar solution in their FastAPI project.
Learners who want a hands-on example of combining FastAPI with SQLAlchemy and Jinja2.

🏗️ Key Features
FastAPI Integration: A modern and fast backend framework to handle HTTP requests.
FullCalendar: A powerful JavaScript library to create dynamic, interactive calendars.
SQLAlchemy: A Python SQL toolkit that provides full ORM capabilities.
